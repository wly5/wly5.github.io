This document is a place of a brief description of this repository, updates, and next steps that need to be done.

This is where I will post my resume, a portfolio of some of the work I have done, and possibly recommendation of things I use to help make my life easier.

Next step:
- Fill in my details from my resume onto the site
- Make it look pretty with HTML/CSS
- Upload some of my work with links, and upload the code for them in a different respository on my GitHub
